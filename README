# big-data-ml-assignment-solution-pack
In Lab 11, you have learned how to create and evaluate a machine learning model, then predict using the model​. In this project you are asked to practice the skills on a different dataset - ​Chicago Taxi Trips​, this dataset includes taxi trips from 2013 to the present, reported to the City of Chicago.
Your task here is to
- use the python scikit-learn to investigate the similarities and relationships that PCA can provide. It will not be possible for you to analyze the entire data set in this way so you should perform your analysis on *the first 1000 rows* of the table. Ideally the output of this phase should guide the direction you take in the second, ML, part of the assignment. You will need to decide which columns should be part of your analysis and which should be ignored. See some of the tutorial links we have posted in the lecture slides for help in deciding what are appropriate columns to consider.
- based on the information you gained from step 1, create a model1 to predict the taxi fare (“fare” column in the dataset). Note that you may need to clean the data, pick a list of features (feature engineering), and then design your model.
